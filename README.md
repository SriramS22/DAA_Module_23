# EX 5A Minimum Cost Path
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a Python program using A Naive recursive implementation of Minimum Cost Path Problem.

## Algorithm
1.Start by reading the number of rows R and columns C from the user.
2. Define a recursive function minCost(cost, m, n) that computes the minimum cost to reach cell (m, n) from (0, 0).
3. Check base conditions:
    If m < 0 or n < 0, return a very large number (infinity-like) to avoid invalid paths.
    If m == 0 and n == 0, return the cost at (0, 0) as it's the starting point.

4.Recursively calculate the minimum of the three possible directions (diagonal, up, left) and add the current cellâ€™s cost.   
5. Print the minimum cost to reach cell (R-1, C-1) using the recursive function.  

## Program:
```

```
```python
R = int(input())
C = int(input())
import sys
def minCost(cost, m, n):
    if (n < 0 or m < 0):
        return sys.maxsize
    elif (m == 0 and n == 0):
        return cost[m][n]
    else:
        return cost[m][n] + min( minCost(cost, m-1, n-1),
                                minCost(cost, m-1, n),
                                minCost(cost, m, n-1) )
def min(x, y, z):
    if (x < y):
        return x if (x < z) else z
    else:
        return y if (y < z) else z
cost= [ [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 8, 2],
        [1, 5, 3] ]
print(minCost(cost, R-1, C-1))

# EX 5B Coin Change Problem
## DATE:
## AIM:
To compute the fewest number of coins that we need to make up the amount given.


## Algorithm
1. Start by reading the number of coin denominations (n), the list of denominations (s), and the target amount (amt).
2. Initialize a dynamic programming (DP) array dp of size amt + 1, with all values set to infinity (inf) except dp[0], which is set to 0 (0 coins needed to make       amount 0). 
3. Iterate through each coin in the list of denominations. 
4. Update the DP array: For each coin, update all entries from coin to amt using the relation dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1), meaning use the coin if it         leads to a smaller count.
5. Return the final result: If dp[amt] is still infinity, return -1 (amount cannot be formed); otherwise, return dp[amt].  

## Program:

```

```

```python

   def coinChange(self, coins, amount):
       dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
       dp[0]=0
       for coin in coins:
           for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
               dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
       return dp[amount] if dp[amount]!=float('inf') else -1
      
ob1 = Solution()
n=int(input())
s=[]
amt=int(input())
for i in range(n):
    s.append(int(input()))


print(ob1.coinChange(s,amt))

# EX 5C Kadane's Algorithm
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a python program to find the maximum contiguous subarray.


## Algorithm
1. Start by reading the number of elements n and the list of integers a[].
2. Initialize two variables:
    max_till_now to store the overall maximum subarray sum (start with the first element).
    max_ending to store the current subarray sum (start with 0).
3. Traverse the array from index 0 to n-1 using a loop.
4. Update max_ending by adding the current element. If max_ending becomes negative, reset it to 0. If max_ending exceeds max_till_now, update max_till_now. 
5. Return or print max_till_now as the maximum contiguous subarray sum.  

## Program:
```
/*
To implement the program to find the maximum contiguous subarray.
Developed by: sriram s
RegisterNumber: 212222240105
*/
```

```python
def maxSubArraySum(a,size):
    
    max_till_now = a[0]
    max_ending = 0
    
    for i in range(0, size):
        max_ending = max_ending + a[i]
        if max_ending < 0:
            max_ending = 0
        
        
        elif (max_till_now < max_ending):
            max_till_now = max_ending
            
    return max_till_now
n=int(input())  
a =[] 
for i in range(n):
    a.append(int(input()))
  
print("Maximum contiguous sum is", maxSubArraySum(a,n))
```

# EX 5D Minimum Jump to Reach End Array
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a python program for finding the minimum number of jumps needed to reach end of the array using Dynamic Programming.


## Algorithm
1. Start by reading the size of the array n and input the elements of the array arr[].
2. Initialize a jumps[] array of size n where jumps[i] will hold the minimum number of jumps required to reach index i. Set jumps[0] = 0 as no jumps are needed to     reach the start.
3. Loop through the array from index 1 to n-1 to fill jumps[i] by checking all previous indices j (from 0 to i-1).
4. Check if index i is reachable from index j using the condition i <= j + arr[j] and update jumps[i] = min(jumps[i], jumps[j] + 1) if jumps[j] is not infinity. 
5. Return or print jumps[n-1] which contains the minimum number of jumps to reach the last index.   

## Program:
```
/*
To implement the program to finding the minimum number of jumps needed to reach end of the array.
Developed by: sriram s
RegisterNumber: 212222240105
*/
```

```python
def minJumps(arr, l, h):
    if (h == l):
        return 0
    if (arr[l] == 0):
        return float('inf')
    min = float('inf')
    for i in range(l + 1, h + 1):
        if (i < l + arr[l] + 1):
            jumps = minJumps(arr, i, h)
            if (jumps != float('inf') and
                       jumps + 1 < min):
                min = jumps + 1
 
    return min
arr = []
n = int(input()) #len(arr)
for i in range(n):
    arr.append(int(input()))
print('Minimum number of jumps to reach','end is', minJumps(arr, 0, n-1))
```
